# SpeedTestDashboard
Show your local download speed over time in an easy to use dashboard. 

The python script SpeedTest2CSV.py tests your local download speed and writes the information to a local csv file. 

NetworkStatisticsbatch.bat can be used as a periodic windows task to run the python script. You would need to change the file paths for it to work in your system. For Windows you can follow https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-schedule-batch-file-run-automatically-windows-7 to setup a regular task to do so.
